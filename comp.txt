The objective of the course is for students to develop proficiency in program design and construction using a high-level programming language. Topics covered include: fundamental programming concepts, the C programming language, programming style, program design and organisation, program testing and debugging. Practical experience of these topics is supplied through laboratory exercises and programming assignments.Additional Information:This course is designed for non-computing majors who want a solid introduction to programming, with the aim of using computers as part of some other discipline. It does not assume any prior background in programming.Electrical Engineering, Telecommunications, Mechanical Engineering, and Mechatronic Engineering specify this as the standard first year computing course. COMP1911 and the following course COMP1521 provide a solid introduction to programming an computer systems concepts for all of these students.Students with an interest in computing or who wish to be extended might want to consider COMP1511 as an alternative, especially if they plan to study more computing as part of their future study. Students from all degrees are permitted to take COMP1511 instead of COMP1911.Note: Because of significant content overlap, students cannot take both COMP1911 and COMP1511.

The course addresses the skills and knowledge required in industry to brainstorm, design, implement, and evaluate an application through the user-centred design process. Because this is an iterative process, students will be required to build their interface at least three times, starting with a low-fidelity prototype and building to high-fidelity and more complete prototypes. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the importance of user-centred design and how it is applied in the industry to design, test and build a functioning application. The course is built to reflect up-to-date industry practice and methods. You would have benefitted from also completing COMP2911, which introduces you to object-oriented techniques, UML and design patterns. Whilst you will be coding in this course to build an iteration of your application, this is not the focus of the course, which remains on design practices and testing of graphical user interfaces.

They are only a part of the large body of  good programming practices,  distinguished from that larger set because  for the methods we consider  the computer-science community has determined the science behind the structures: we know why they are effective.Unusually, this course does not take the traditional route of teaching that science first, and then turning it into practical programming  tools-of-thought.  Instead, we teach the mental tools first, try them on examples and only then, once their effectiveness has been demonstrated, will we look behind the scenes to see where they come from.Initially the material will deal with conventional programs, those that must  give the right output.  (This is known as functional correctness, and a sorting program is a simple example.) Later in the course we will look at additional correctness criteria, such as security (perform this calculation in a way that keeps part of the answer hidden) and randomisation (implement over-the-internet protocols that depend intrinsically on coin-flipping). Those last two topics will draw on up-to-the-minute research.

Ideally, one would want to design algorithms that solve each instance exactly and in polynomial time. But since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any NP-hard problem, we will relax these requirements and design algorithms that either do not solve the problem exactly, that only solve a subset of instances, or whose worst-case running time is super-polynomial in the input size or some other parameter of the input.Among algorithms that do not solve the problem exactly, we discuss heuristics and approximation algorithms. Heuristics do not guarantee to compute optimal solutions but tend to work well in practice. Approximation algorithms give additional guarantees of the quality of computed solution as compared to the optimal solution.Among algorithms that only solve a subset of instances, we discuss graph classes where NP-hard graph problems often become polynomial-time solvable when the input is restricted to these classes.Among algorithms that do not run in polynomial time, we discuss exponential-time algorithms and parameterized algorithms. In exponential-time algorithms we discuss algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case. In parameterized algorithms, a parameter k is associated with each instance and the goal is to design algorithms whose worst-case running time is fast whenever k is small. We will also see lower bounds for problems and how to rule out certain running times under various complexity assumptions.
